In these sections of "The Digital Humanities : A Primer for Students and Scholars", Gardiner and Musto provide an introduction to the concept of the Digital Humanities, and talk about the transition of the study of the humanities to the modern practices. The two authors discuss how data is gathered and how it is used for humanities, drawing comparisons with the sciences. Two of the major points that Gardiner and Musto discuss are the scientific lens that is applied within the humanities, and the fact that the humanities have evolved with the introduction of digital methods.

The authors discuss the parallels between the practices between the humanities and the sciences. Similar to the empirical practices of the sciences, the study of the humanities employs "empirical methods". Afterwards, they collect "data on society and social groups, then process that data quantitatively." Similar to the sciences, the social sciences collect and process data in order to understand function, simply for different disciplines. Gardiner and Musto note that both groups try to use methods to create "as close a model of the 'real world' as possible." The authors also note that the misconceptions surrounding the methods employed in the humanities, at least in academia, may stem from the fact that "the administration of colleges and universities may not come from a humanist background." Since most of the administration may not be familiar with the humanities, we may not be effectively showcasing the type of work that is used in the humanities.

Gardiner and Musto also address the fact that the humanities have evolved over time. They note that the modern humanist is "exposed to vast arrays of source materials being digitized and accessible over the web". This is in sharp contrast to the old practices of " sifting through manuscripts and copying them by hand." They note that as technology and the world has evolved, the study of the humanities has evolved. The digitization of the study has introduced "increased speed and lowered cost of research", which is seen across many fields of study.

After this reading, I was wondering about the negative effects of digitization that are introduced to new fields. The authors mention that with increased speed of research, there is a temptation to "publish findings too quickly". Are these drawbacks present in other disciplines which use digitized studies?
