In this excerpt of "What Are the Humanities For", Drees gives context to the study of humanities. He first gives an explanation for the humanities and outlines some misconceptions about the subject by providing analogies to other fields of study. He later outlines motivations for studying the humanities, of which include the human nature to seek knowledge. Throughout the reading, Drees develops an argument for the importance of the humanities, and emphasizes that "humanities" is a general term which provides misconceptions.

Drees emphasizes the fact that "humanities" is a  general term. He notes that the study of the humanities includes drastically different concepts, such as " history, languages, religions, and art from various times and places ... ". While acknowledging the multidisciplinary nature of the field, he notes that "' 'humanity' does not refer to individual disciplines". He makes a note of this in order to create a direct comparison between the humanities and sciences. In the study of the sciences, any given subject within the field can be called a "science". However, any given subject within the humanities is not referred to as a "humanity". This point is made to clear up the misconception that while there is no similar term to delineate a certain subject within the humanities, we can consider the topic analogous to that of the sciences.

Another point Drees discusses is the importance of the humanities for growth and understanding. He notes the value of learning from the culture and histories of people in the past, stating that by "studying their art and their beliefs, we may come to reconsider our own beliefs and expressions as well." This would allow us to "navigate this complex world with other humans" more effectively.

After this reading, I found myself wondering about the misconception of the humanities. Why do we treat all the various disciplines as part of the same concept instead of separating them?
