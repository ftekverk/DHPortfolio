## Evaluation
"Enslaved" is a repository of information about the slave trade. It built upon an earlier Digital Humanities project, "Slave Biographies: The Atlantic Database Network", and introduced more structure and analysis. The project was a collaborative effort spearheaded by faculty at MSU, and included work from members of the University of Maryland and Matrix.
The project outlines a few objectives, such as denoting the history and journey of the people involved in the slave trade, presenting stories of individuals through various means, and preserving the datasets containing this information. 

"Enslaved" answers questions about certain demographics of slaves, such as the age distribution of slaves mentioned in their database. It shows data about age and gender demographics, as well as the ethnicity of the slaves. Furthermore, the data is labeled to categorize the various roles of the people involved in the trade, such as buyers, runaways, etc. The data also categorizes the type of work that the various slaves performed, when applicable.
The main strength of "Enslaved" is their large database. While it would be impossible to capture a wholistic picture of the slave trade, this project operates as a centralized repository for a vast amount of topical information. It has good visualizations of a few types of data which help to identify trends of the slave trade, such as gender and age breakdowns. The project also has a very clear and modern interface, which makes it easy to find and access the data.
The main drawback I have encountered with this project is the difficulty to distinguish historically relevant/ fascinating information from other data. "Enslaved" offers the user access to vast amounts of data, but there is no obvious way to tell if the data had historical impact. As an example, if the user views events, they are presented with hundreds of events of births. It is hard to tell if these children born are followed in the dataset, or lead interesting lives. In other words, it is hard to tell the connections between data points, since they all appear to be standalone events. This diminishes from one of the goals of "Enslaved" in detailing the stories of enslaved people.
