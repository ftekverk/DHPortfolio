## Evaluation

"Robots Reading Vogue" encompasses the analysis of over a century of Vogue publications. The project is set-up by Yale University Library, and is built off of the Vogue Archive. The project shares several examples of how the Vogue data can be analyzed over time, such as word and advertisement usage. 
The goal of this project was originally to create an "interesting digital humanities" project. This project stemmed from Yale's Librarian for Digital Humanities research at the time, Peter Leonard, who wanted to create a project from an existing repository of text and images. The use of the Vogue Archive was suggested to him, and "Robots Reading Vogue" was created.

"Robots Reading Vogue" introduces a few ways that they have analyzed the data encompassed in Vogue publications. For example, to study "the shifting notion of beauty", the project uses word vectors. This word vector technology analyzes words which appear close in proximity to each other in text, and uses this data to identify trends and draw conclusions. The data indicates that in the 1890s, beauty was treated as a character trait similar to personality, however this notion has evolved over time. Furthermore, topic modeling is used to show the  co-occurrence of certain art and dressmaking phrases over time.

However, users do not seem to be able to use these modules for their own analyses, they are limited to the analyses performed by Yale library. Using the same technologies, the project could be used to answer questions like the following:

1.) How have beauty standards evolved (using cover data, and topic modeling)
2.) How has the role of women evolved in society ( word vectors, topic modeling)
3.) The rise and fall of industries (ad frequencies)

The project could be improved by allowing users to use the existing database to analyze associations that they choose. For example, rather than see how fashion has been discussed, users should be able to provide words to see the associated words used over time. This would make this tool much more powerful and applicable in analyzing more trends across the century of collected data.
